## Overview

This Spring Boot application exposes a rest service to consult the final price of a product.

It was designed to comply with a **[Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software))** and also to comply with **[SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)**.

## Technology Stack

* **Common**
  * [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
  * [Maven 3.x](https://maven.apache.org/)
  * [Spring Boot v3](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  * [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): Helper to create builders, setters, getters, etc.
  * [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/): Helper to create mappers to pass objects between the different layers.
* **Data & Persistence**
  * [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa): JPA based repositories implementation.
  * [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/): To load database migrations at application startup.
  * [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/): Very fast, open source, JDBC API. Support embedded and server modes; disk-based or in-memory databases
* **RestAPI**
  * [springdoc-openapi-ui](https://springdoc.org/): Helps to automate the generation of API documentation using spring boot projects.
  * [rest-assured](https://rest-assured.io/): REST Assured is a Java DSL for simplifying testing of REST based services.

## Application Structure

| Module                      | Description                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ecommerce-parent            | Module for inheriting common configurations, dependencies, and plugins.               |
| -- ecommerce-application    | Part of the business logic is centralized in this layer.                              |
| -- ecommerce-bootloader     | Module to launch Spring Boot application, run tests and coverage reports.             |
| -- ecommerce-domain         | Here the POJO classes and domain interfaces are centralized.                          |
| -- ecommerce-infrastructure | Adapters such as Rest and access to Persistence (JPA) are centralized in this module. |

## How to Build and Run

### Pre-requisites
* Java 17
* Maven 3.8.x

### Step 1 - BUILD
Go to the project root directory and execute the following command to compile, test, package and install the different artifacts in your local maven repository.

```shell
mvn clean install
```
Or use the embedded **Maven Wrapper** if you don't have a maven installation.

```shell
./mvnw clean install
```

### Step 2 - RUN
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you do not have any applications running on port `8080` before running this program.

After creating all artifacts you can run the project with the following command:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -pl ecommerce-bootloader
```
Or use the embedded **Maven Wrapper** if you don't have a maven installation.

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl ecommerce-bootloader
```
### Step 3 - DONE!
You should see in the console the following log line:

```log
......
2024-04-25T01:29:26.228-03:00  INFO 45458 --- [           main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path ''
2024-04-25T01:29:26.234-03:00  INFO 45458 --- [           main] c.e.b.EcommerceSpringBootApplication     : Started EcommerceSpringBootApplication in 1.841 seconds (process running for 1.959)
```

## URLs and Endpoints

| URL                                   | Description                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html | Swagger interface based on the OpenAPI auto-generated schema that helps you to test the `prices` resource endpoint. |
| http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs     | OpenAPI schema auto-generated from the swagger annotation provided by the `springdoc` dependency.                   |
| http://localhost:8080/api/v1/prices   | GET http method that will receive three parameters.                                                                 |
| http://localhost:8080/h2              | H2 Database Console (**URL:** `jdbc:h2:mem:test`, **User:** `sa`, **Password:** `password`)                         |

## Testing

### How to run test
```shell
mvn clean test
```
Or use the embedded **Maven Wrapper** if you don't have a maven installation.
```shell
./mvnw clean test
```

### How to generate a coverage report
```shell
mvn clean verify
```
Or use the embedded **Maven Wrapper** if you don't have a maven installation.
```shell
./mvnw clean verify
```

#### Done! 
The code coverage report will be generated in the following path: `ecommerce-bootloader/target/index.html`
